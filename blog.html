<h5>Date : August 20, 2023</h5>
<h5>Author: Seydenu Sam Seneh</h5>
<p>This week at the K.I.T, i've learned how to use HTML tags, how to use some attributes in HTML. I've also learned about <strong>VARIABLES</strong> which are simply like a container that stores values. <strong>DATA TYPES </strong> which is a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take. <strong>FUNCTIONS</strong> In JavaScript it's similar to the procedure or set of statement thatperforms a taskor calculate a valuee. & also <strong>ARRAYS</strong> which are variables that hold multiple values. And those ones were learned in JavaScript.</p>
